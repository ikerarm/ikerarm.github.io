                <p> My name is Iker Armendariz, I was born on June 30th, 2009 in Ciudad Juarez Chihuahua Mexico. I am 15 years old, and I love playing soccer. 
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer with my friends, watching games,
                    or following my favorite teams. Soccer is my passion, and it inspires me to
                    improve every day.

                     hanging out or working at school. They’re the kind of people who always have my back, and I know I can count on them.
